Toolmoor Truth and Healing Embassy / Jarjumbah Protection Site acknowledges Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People as the First people and original carers of the lands and waters of this continent. Sovereignty was never ceded. 

We recognise the Yuggera and Ugarapul People as the rightful owners of the lands on which the former Deebing Creek Mission sits. We also recognise the many First Nations groups who were forcibly removed from their lands and families and sent to the Mission. 

We acknowledge and celebrate the rich diversity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures as the oldest continuous cultures in the world and pay our respects to Elders, knowledge keepers and leaders - past, present, and future.
