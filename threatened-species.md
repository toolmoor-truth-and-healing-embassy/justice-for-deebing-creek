Jarjumbah Protection Site is home to a number of threatened and critically endangered species of flora and fauna.

The site is an important nature corridor - some of the last remaining koala habitat in the region due to deforestation, pollution, and "development". In February 2022, the status of koalas was upgraded to Critically Endangered. The main reasons for koalas' endangerment include deforestation, land clearing and urban development. There have been a number of koalas spotted onsite and evidence of this area as an important koala corridor has been documented in reports to "developers". They knowingly want to destroy this crucial ecosystem.

There is also a melaleuca irbyana (commonly known as the swamp tea tree or weeping paperbark) forest located here, a species that has been listed under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act as Critically Endangered. The species belongs to the myrtle family, Myrtacea, and is endemic to the areas of New South Wales and Queensland in so-called Australia. Those proposing to "develop" the site have acknowledged the presence of these trees in the leaked Protected Flora Survey Report in February 2021. Traditionally, these trees have a number of uses in First Nations communities, included medicinal (teas) and cultural (bark paintings). 

A list of species identified in the land surveys will be uploaded soon. Stay tuned.
